=== Retrievals
The three phases in retrieval:

. Chunking
. Embedding
. Vector Searching

NOTE: Chunking and Embedding are for _data preparations_ +
      Vector Searching is for the _searching_ and _returning_ results.
      
==== Chunking
The breaking down of large piece of text into smaller `segments` or `chunks`.

* Reduce generation costs
* Focus the attention of the LLM on the most relevant information.
